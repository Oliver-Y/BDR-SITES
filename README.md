# BDR-SITES - Segmented Intranet for Technical and Executive Services
This repository is inteded to serve as a sobmodule for [BDR-site_router](https://github.com/wcr3/BDR-site_router).  It is a collection of sites intended to ease logistical headaches associated with building a racecar.

## LIMBS - Local Inventory Mangement and Backup System

### Summary
The intention of this project is to build an inventory management platform BDR in hopes of vastly decreasing the time/money spent looking for tools and parts.  Future plans include automated BOM creation, integration with design files and integration with Project Management materials.

The hope is that this project will eventually be integrated with other sites for automation and maintenance of BDR documentation and competition materials, tailored specifically for Formula Hybrid and FSAE.

### Framework
The site interfaces with a server-side MySQL database of tools, components, parts, shelves, systems, suppliers, and purchases.
